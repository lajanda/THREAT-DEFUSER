# WP4: Synthesis; Point Persons: Gjørv & Trosterud
Results from WP1-3 come together in comparisons across languages, countries, and media, exposing trends and differences. Political implications are identified, and strategies are developed to address gaps in knowledge. Discourse analyses of central texts addressing hybrid threats (in Russian, Norwegian/North Saami, and English) will be conducted and triangulated with results from WP2 and 3 which will result in a multiple trajectory (quantitative and qualitative) knowledge base of key threat-oriented language used in various media. This knowledge base will serve as the foundation for WP5 and creation of the NewsRadar plug-in. WP 4 will use qualitative methods (surveys, participant observation, interviews) to gather data on how individuals in Norway, Sápmi, and NW-Russia actually receive, negotiate, and potentially repurpose or subvert allegedly radicalizing content disseminated in and through digital networks. This shift of focus on media practices takes seriously the agency of individual citizens and will help identify various machinic agencies interacting and interfering with human users. The WP will produce qualitative data sets on actual behavior with which assembled quantitative data sets on abstracted aggregates can be correlated to control for validity and reduce biases caused by selection of sources and other factors.
