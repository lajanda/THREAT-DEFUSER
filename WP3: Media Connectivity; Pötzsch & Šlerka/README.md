# WP3: Media Connectivity; Point Persons: Pötzsch & Šlerka
WP3 will critically interrogate the interface between civilian and media agency, and devise concrete strategies for communication, verification, and de-escalation with regard to perceived threats. These communication strategies will be simultaneously shared and tested with the other WPs. The spectrum of media sources in Norway and Russia and their audiences are probed for connectivity, tracked in terms of social media likes of news posts and measured in terms of Normalized Social Distance (Šlerka & Šisler 2017); Šlerka provides knowledge transfer to apply also to Russian social media (*VKontakte*, *Odnoklassniki*, *moj mir*). Media maps for each country are constructed and groupings of media sources are classified. In addition, this WP addresses processes and practices of escalation and radicalization in an extended security paradigm by investigating the intersecting dynamics of new media technologies (in particular social media and digital networks) and the mediation of perceived threats through populism and extremism. WP3 investigates the relationships between increasing global trends in populism and various expressions of agency through extremism in response to perceived threats. Relying on intersectional analysis (closely connected to feminist/gender analysis) we can better contextualize and understand the technological, economic, cultural, societal, and political patterns of support and restraint predisposing civilians’ cognition and actions in encounters with perceptions of invisible threats. Addressing the role of civilians in contemporary media-fueled affective (emotional) politics in Western democracies, WP3 employs theories of trust and civilian capabilities/agency (informed by intersectional analysis) to understand the politicized roles of civilians in emerging crisis scenarios, with a particular focus on the role of media technologies, institutions, and practices in creating/maintaining/destabilizing environments that foster populism, and further various forms of extremism.
